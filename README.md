# Python Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to data analysis using Python. It demonstrates the complete workflow of loading, exploring, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset. The classic Iris flower dataset is used for this analysis.

## Project Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn and pandas, then inspects its structure, data types, and checks for missing values.

Basic Data Analysis: Computes descriptive statistics and performs a groupby operation to analyze the average measurements for each flower species.

Data Visualization: Creates four distinct plots to visually represent the data and the findings from the analysis, using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install all the necessary libraries with a single command:

Bash

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
## Usage
Make sure you have all the required libraries installed.

Save the Python code as a file (e.g., analysis.py).

Run the script from your terminal:

Bash

python analysis.py
The script will print the analysis results to the console and display the visualization plots in separate windows.

## Visualizations Created
This project generates the following plots to help understand the Iris dataset:

Line Chart: Shows the trend of sepal length across all samples in the dataset.

Bar Chart: Compares the average petal length across the three different iris species.

Histogram: Displays the frequency distribution of petal width.

Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between sepal length and sepal width, with points colored by species.
